## eXtended Dynalign 1.0

# INTRODUCTION

This GitHub repository contains information about the software system
eXtended Dynalign (X-Dynalign for short). This program takes as input three
RNA sequences and produces a three-way sequence alignment, as well as a
common secondary structure.  The objective function consists of a
linear combination of the free-energy of each sequence, given the
common secondary structure, and an empirical term for gap penalties.

# HISTORY

X-Dynalign is a direct extension of Dynalign, written by David
Mathews.  X-Dynalign was developed at the University of Ottawa by
Beeta Masoumi under the supervision of Marcel Turcotte.

# PUBLICATIONS

The project is documented by the following publications.
